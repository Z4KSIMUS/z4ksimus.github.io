		<blockquote>I think a lot about writing. I think that happens when you spend too much time reading instead of actually living your life. That's not unique to reading - I found it was common to find online movie reviewers who watch a lot of movies talk about wanting to direct their own films. I would guess that one of the reasons "YouTuber" is one of the most desired careers among kids is because they watch a lot of YouTube.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>Ultimately, instead of writing my Great American Novel, I decided to just cough up some of my dank, soupy, mosquito-infested thoughts all over a static webpage. That's okay though, this isn't a blog, it's a bog.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>If you came here without insect repellent, that's on you.</blockquote>
