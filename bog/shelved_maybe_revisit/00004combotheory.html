	<h2>Preface</h2>
		<p>First, this bogpost is about my framework for learning, in general. I've picked an obscure topic as my example - the offensive theory of the sole character in a very simple and small fighting game. It makes for a niche, not too complex topic that very few people will already be familiar with, so you can kinda experience learning the concept as you follow the post. <mark>The fighting game being looked at here is not the important part. You could apply this <b>learning framework</b> to literally anything.</mark></p>
		<p>Second, I'm not an expert on fighting games in general. What you're about to read is me stumbling my way through learning this character's combo theory, so that should go without saying, but I'll say it here to emphasize.</p>
		<p>Third, I don't break EVERYTHING I EVER LEARN down into this much detail. I wish I had the mental bandwidth to do so, but in life, one must prioritize. That being said, this learning philosophy does colour how I subconsciously learn things that I don't dedicate deliberate effort to learning, so it's not as though this framework only comes into play when I sit and break everything down.</p>
		<p>Finally, I'm not pretending to say this is the right or optimal or only way to learn things. This is just my conceptualization. <mark>pls no flame</mark></p>

	<h2>People Who Are Good at Everything</h2>
		<p>You ever meet someone who just seems to be good at literally everything they do? You know, when you go to your high school graduation, and they announce how the valedictorian has a 98% average in all his classes, was on the wrestling team, the chess team, the debate club, played trumpet in band, had a supporting role in the school play, works an internship at a law firm, developed a dating sim that won some game jam, got his short story published in the local newspaper, volunteers at an orphanage, and has TWO hot boyfriends... and it makes you go "damn. i kinda just suck"? How did that guy get so good at everything?</p>
		<p>Well first of all, let me acknowledge that yes, some people are probably possess specific innate talents, and some people might be gifted in aspects (like IQ) that help them be competent at a lot of things even. But that seems to be beyond our control, so we'll move on from that.</p>
		<p>Second, I will say that yes, some people have access to better resources or more time. Sometimes this is just a matter of them proritizing different activities, sometimes it's a matter of work ethic, and sometimes money buys the best tutors â€” but it's not healthy to dwell on that if you don't have said money.</p>
		<p>The third reason I think some people seem to be good at everything is that they have an aptitiude for learning. This could be another innate aptitude, but in my experience, learning how to learn seems to be a skill that can be... learned. I certainly feel as though I got better at learning things the more things I tried to learn.</p>
		<p>Finally, I don't think most people who seem to be good at everything are actually GOOD at everything. They're just competent at everything (still impressive, mind you). Which leads me to...</p>

	<h2>The Pareto Principle</h2>
		<blockquote><i>In 1941, Joseph M. Juran, a Romanian-born American engineer, came across the work of Italian polymath Vilfredo Pareto. Pareto noted that approximately 80% of Italy's land was owned by 20% of the population. <mark>Juran applied the observation that 80% of an issue is caused by 20% of the causes to quality issues.</mark> Later during his career, Juran preferred to describe this as "the vital few and the useful many" to highlight that the contribution of the remaining 80% should not be discarded entirely.</i></blockquote>
		<blockquote>- From Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle#History"><i>History</i> section on the <i>"Pareto Principle"</i> page</a></blockquote>
		<p>The Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, is the idea that 20% of your input results in 80% of your outcomes.</p>
		<p>I would argue that most people who appear to be good at everything have just put that 20% of effort required for 80% of the gains into a lot of different things. It is not common for athletes to be professionally competitive in multiple sports, or experts in multiple fields of study. When that does happen, it usually happens in domains that are closely related to one another.</p>

		<p>The trouble with the 80/20 rule when it comes to learning is that it might not be immediately clear <b>which 20%</b> is going to give you 80% of the results.</p>
		<p>To figure that out, I have two main approaches. The first, is to seek the wisdom of those who came before me. The second, is to dig straight to bedrock and piece the logic of the thing myself.</p>
		<p>These aren't exactly two separate modes, and in this example, I'm going to use a few resources to guide my fundamental understandings, and in turn my fundamental understandings will help me fully exploit certain resources.</p>

	<h2>Hierarchies of Emergence</h2>
		<p>To be brief, this XKCD comic comes to mind whenever I'm thinking of "fundamental concepts":</p>
		<br><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/purity.png", height="250">
		<p>Borp calls this kind of pattern a <a href="https://philosophicaltreasures.com/hierarchies-of-emergence/">hierarchy of emergence</a>, and I'm happy to name it the same thing. My approach to learning follows a hierarchy of emergence.</p>
